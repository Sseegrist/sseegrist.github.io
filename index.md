## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, part 1
I enjoyed this lab because iI quickly figured out how to convert each measurement. I enjoyed writing the conversions of each measurement because it was simple and followed a pattern. For example, I could use the format used in converting tsp to tbsp to convert tbsp to cups.

Lab 7
I enjoyed this lab because it was challenging to work out how to calculate times on integers. Time is difficult to work with because it runs from 1 - 60 minutes rather than 1 - 100. This was a challenge when testing for a time with a limit of 6:30.

Lab 8, part 2
I enjoyed this lab because it was simple and satisfying seeing the pattern results of each test. Changing the values in either for loop would change the way the pattern behaved in its output. The fix was clean and simple, which is why I enjoyed it.
